Delicious AJAX library that works on both node.js server and browser. In the browser it detects cross domain requests and then it falls back into iframe proxy method.

Count word in file. Including multiple ocurrencies in one line

grep -o string * | wc -l

Count words in file. One per line

Keep in mind. 
-------------

It's often the same with any new, revolutionary thing. 
People get stuck as they get older. Our minds are sort of electrochemical computers. 
Your thoughts construct patterns like scaffolding in your mind. You are really etching chemical patterns. 
In most cases, people get stuck in those patterns, just like grooves in a record, and they never get out of them. 
It's a rare person who etches grooves that are other than a specific way of looking at things, a specific way of questioning things. 
It's rare that you see an artist in his 30s or 40s able to really contribute something amazing. 
Of course, there are some people who are innately curious, forever little kids in their awe of life, but they're rare.

Well, my favorite things in life are books, sushi and.... My favorite things in life don't cost any money. 
It's really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time.

And what computer programming can do is to capture the underlying principles, the underlying essence, and then facilitate thousands of
experiences based on that perception of the underlying principles. Now, what if we could capture Aristotle's world view the 
underlying principles of his world view? Then you could actually ask Aristotle a question.

Trim in Javascript
------------------

if (typeof String.prototype.trim !== 'function'){
  String.prototype.trim = function (){
    return this.replace(/^\s*(\S*(\s+\S+)*)\s*$/, "$1");
  };
}

Supplant in Javascript (templating)
------------------------------------

if (typeof String.prototype.supplant !== 'function'){
  String.prototype.supplant = function(o){
    return this.replace(/{{[^{}]*}})/g, 
      function(a,b){
        var r = o[b];
        return typeof r === 'string' ? r : a;
      });
  };
}

ADASS Presentation Idea
------------------------

Exercise of web purism

Building on the root concept of the web. Resource linking

Every piece of information has its own Url. Cache, bookmark, index and link...

Front ends on top of the API. Show off concept with iPad application interacting with desktop browser

Reasons iframes
----------------

Sandboxing: No global state leak

Gadget developers get to pick whatever libraries they prefer.

ASCOT Data Core Concept
------------------------

Contributory database: User provides their own data in exchange for receiving a more robust set of aggregated data back that provides insight into the broader domain, or provides a vehicle for expressing a view. Give a little, get a lot back in return

Web based data processing platform: Pull data from a wide array of sources, integrate it into a unified stream, make it consumable via a dashboard or through an API

Lazy data modeling: Instead of trying to guess the future we store data "as-is" and deal with transformation when a necessary use case arises. 

Ascot enables users to receive immediate feedback for any contributions. It reduces the feedback look.

ASCOT Usability Philosophy
--------------------------

Rule of fifteen minutes: For each new API, language, or format a person of reasonable ability should be able to get from zero to ‘Hello World’ in fifteen minutes

We will provide support with existing XML based systems but we don't support it
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

XML = Data bureaucracy. We don't want to spend time formalizing, serializing, parsing and translating data. We want to use data. We want to be flexible and iterate fast. XML is not agile.

XML is verbose. We plan to deal with big data sets. XML introduce an overhead in memory, storage and CPU costs.

XML is ugly and complex for programmers. Reading and writing XML is unpleasant.

Communications Libraries
------------------------

NowJS - Current. Loss of messages, disconnections and slow with big pieces of data. 
Faye - Bayeux Protocol
Juggernaut - Separated Server
pubsub.io - No channels. Subscribers provide queries and receive data satisfying those queries. Interesting concept.

I would like to get hard numbers to compare performance of the different solutions.
