# # Decompress

# Module will contain various decompression algorithms used in compressing FITS images.  Currently only
# the Rice decompression algorithm is implemented.  The four adopted algorithms are:

# * Rice
# * Gzip
# * IRAF PLIO
# * H-Compress

  # ### Rice
  # * array: Array of compressed bytes to be decompressed
  # * arrayLen: Length of array
  # * blocksize: Number of pixels encoded in a block
  # * bytepix: Number of 8-bit bytes of the original integer pixel
  # * pixels: Output array containing the decompressed values
  # * nx: Length of pixels (ztile1)
